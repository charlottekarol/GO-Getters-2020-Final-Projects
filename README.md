# GO-Getters-2020-Final-Projects

Hi there! Welcome to the final project showcase for the GO Getter Summer 2020 Virtual Course. 

This summer, we welcomed 31 high school students to the program and invited them to engage in discussions/activities throughout the 5-week virtual course to understand and unpack the history of school segegration and educational inequities in New York City. GO Getters met twice per week in 16 person cohorts, working in large and small groups to explore how segregation relates to school control, leadership, and choice. We investigated examples of integration efforts and alternatives and debated what solutions can eliminate disparities and how we understand these implications in our own schools and communitites. 

Participants worked in groups to complete a final project where they created a "teach-in" on a specific topic and it's connection with school segregation and integration efforts. 

Please enjoy and learn from their hard work by checking out their videos!
