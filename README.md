# GO-Getters-2020-Final-Projects

Hi there! Welcome to the final project showcase for the GO Getter Summer 2020 Virtual Course. We welcomed 31 high school students to the program this summer and engaged in discussions and activities throughout our 5 weeks to understand and unpack the history of school segegration and educational inequities in New York City. Participants worked in groups to complete a final project where they created a "teach-in" on a specific topic and it's connection with school segregation and integration efforts. 

Please enjoy and learn from their hard work by checking out their videos!
